      <h2>How the data is calculated</h2>
      <p>The displayed values are calculated based on the following methods:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Category Grouping:</strong> Data is grouped by categories, where items 
          are grouped together based on their shared base category (e.g., the part before 
          a dash in their label). This allows for summarizing trends within each group.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Total Value:</strong> The sum of all item values in a category is 
          calculated and displayed as the total value.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Median Value:</strong> The median of all values within a category is 
          calculated and shown as a measure of the middle point of the dataset.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Yearly Trends:</strong> Using past data within a category, an average 
          yearly increase is calculated. This is used to estimate future trends.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Real-Time Updates:</strong> Based on the current date, the data 
          updates dynamically to show estimated progress toward the year's final value.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Dynamic Values</h3>
      <p>
        The values displayed on the counters reflect real-time calculations of progress 
        toward the yearâ€™s estimated totals. These numbers are adjusted incrementally 
        as time progresses.
