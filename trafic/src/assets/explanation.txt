Assets Folder Documentation

The assets folder is designed to keep your project’s resources organized and accessible. Below is a guide on how to use the folders effectively.

Fonts

The fonts folder is where you store custom font files that aren’t readily available through standard font-family names. This is particularly useful for unique or branded typography.

To use a font stored in this folder:
	1.	Place the font file (e.g., .otf or .ttf) in the fonts folder.
	2.	Reference it in your CSS using the @font-face rule, like so:

@font-face {  
  font-family: "Your Custom Font Name";  
  src: url(../assets/fonts/cascadiaMonoItalic-BoldItalic.otf);  
}

Tip: Make sure the url path reflects the actual location of your CSS file relative to the fonts folder.

Images

The images folder, along with its subfolders (e.g., logo, banner), is where all your visual assets are stored.

Why Subfolders?
	•	Subfolders help you keep similar images grouped together, such as logos, banners, or icons.
	•	This organization becomes crucial as your project grows, ensuring you can quickly locate specific assets.

Best Practices:
	1.	Use descriptive names for your image files (e.g., logo-primary.png, homepage-banner.jpg) to make searching easier.
	2.	Save images in optimal formats for performance:
	•	Use .png for transparency.
	•	Use .jpg for photos or large banners.
	•	Consider .webp for better compression without loss of quality.

By maintaining this structure and naming convention, you’ll avoid confusion and ensure your project stays tidy over time.

Following this structure will help you manage your project efficiently and make collaboration with others seamless!
